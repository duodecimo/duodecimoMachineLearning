# duodecimoMachineLearning
This repository will be dedicated to machine learning study, allways focused on implementing code.

My goal is to develop java code that implements machine learning algorithms targeting education.
The code must be clean, self explanatory, clearing covering the algorithm that it implements in order 
to be used as material for machine learning classes. So usually the code you can find here is not made to be 
optimized, rather, it is made to be easy to understand.

The CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) will be used for trainning and tests of neural networks.

I will start by implementing the nn (nearest neighbourg) approach.
