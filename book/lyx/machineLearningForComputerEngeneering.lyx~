MACHINE LEARNING FOR COMPUTER ENGINEERING

\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This books intends to be a resource to be used for studying and researching
 of machine learning in computation, particularly in computer engineering.
 It is directed into developing and explaining computer code, and mathematics
 operations necessary for those who wish to enhance their abilities on this
 field.It is oriented as well for image recognizing and classification, although
 it studies algorithms that can be generically useful on other machine learning
 recognition or classification.
 The code part here is not directed to be used in projects out of the box,
 but rather to produce a trail map to understand and to master the development
 from the basis.
 The motivation comes from my work as an assistant professor for the Computer
 Engineering graduation at Universidade Severino Sombra (USS), located in
 Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro.
 The code will be build on JAVA, the language mostly adopted on the before
 mentioned course.

Some concepts about machine learning

\begin_layout Quote
Machine learning, also called automatic learning, according to Arthur Samuel
 in 1959, gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
 programmed

\begin_layout Standard
Take a little child, for example.
 One points objects to them, and says things like: - 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Look, a dog!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then, - 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There, a car!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and so on.
 A little while further, the child begins to mention the objects when they
 see them.
 The child learned the name of the objects and is able to classify the objects
 to a certain extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some aspects of the learning process must be observed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One just shows the object and labels it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No particular characteristics of the object must be taught (a car has wheels,
 a dog has eyes and mouth, ...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The child is able to recognize up to some extent different objects of the
 same class (several branches of cars, with different color, size and shape,
 several kinds of dogs, races are pretty different).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computer codes are sets of instructions.
 The instructions are very strict, they are operations applied on numerical
 data, like, - "add those and put it there", - "compare those and decide
 what to do based on the result", - "repeat this operations until ...", and
 so on.
 It is an easy task to teach to a child how to recognize a car, one just
 points and label.
 But maybe it is not so easy to teach a computer to do the same thing expressing
 specific computer language instructions.
 This will be discussed in a more profound way further in our classes.
 One can try to express properties of a car components that can leads to
 its correct recognition, like, it must have wheels, a shape of some form
 ...
 just thinking about it will show how hard this task is.
 Maybe we can say we know to recognize a car, but, we don't know how we
 do it.
 Some outbreak brain functioning theories states that our brains have specialize
d areas to process stuff, and several of this areas are out of the conscious
 parts of our brains.
 So, we can do it (by receiving in our sentient part of the brain results
 of processing done in the unconscious part of our brains), but we don't
 know how we do it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computer scientists have try to take several approaches to perform object
 recognition, in the most general field of artificial intelligence.
 There has been some success in characteristics segmentation, but with poor
 generalization effects.
 There is where automatic learning has recently deserving special efforts,
 and has given some promising results.
 We will see that a recognition algorithm does it works by automatically
 selecting some characteristics, but, as they evolve, we have no idea what
 characteristics it is selecting.
 (Usually, a huge amount, and also, a huge blend of them, not necessarily
 something as evident as wheels, corners and wind shields).

We hear about sharks attacking humans by mistaken them for seals.
 So, you are using your black diving suit, and a sharks classifies you as
 a, no offense, seal?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
We mentioned before that machine learning code can perform their task without
 previous definition of the characteristics, or parts of the object, or
 else features that will be accounted for recognizance and classification.
 But it is obvious that we recognize objects, like cars and dogs, by their
 characteristics.
 What is not obvious is what are the better characteristics that will enhance
 our chances of success.

\begin_layout Section
About images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
Several objects may be associated with it's image.
 Naturally an image is an effect of how humans and animals perceive light
 reflection using their visual system.
 Sooner humans found out that images could be represented using drawings
 and sculptures.
 There was the development of photography and movie.
 And then, we arrive at modern digitalized images that are stored and transfered
 trough out modern computers and networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
Images are features, and are composed of a huge set of features that can
 help to characterize, recognize and classify an object.
 Take the cifar-10 set of images.
 There are pictures of animals and other things, like this car:
